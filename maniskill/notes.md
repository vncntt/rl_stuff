## [Simulation and Robotics 101](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts/simulation_101.html)

### Actor types:

Dynamic: fully simulated

Kinematic: partially fully simulated. 
the actor won't move or deform, but will apply forces to dynamic actors.

Static: 
same as kinematic but even less cpu/gpu memory. 

examples of kinematic/static actors are walls, floors, cabinets, etc.


## [GPU Simulation](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts/gpu_simulation.html)

- so much low-level gpu stuff that idrk.


## [Controllers/Action Spaces](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts/controllers.html)
- A controller converts an action into control signals (joint position and velocities) to a robot.

## [Controllers](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts/controllers.html)

- didn't understand most of this. will revisit if i get stuck on something related.
